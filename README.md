# Forked

This repo was forked in order to update the topology and world data to current implementation.
This was done to make above ground trains spawn again after loading/saving the map.

# Rust.World

Welcome to the Rust World SDK. In its current state it allows the creation of tools that load, visualize, edit and save Rust map files.

## Getting Started

* Shaders on loaded prefabs are only working in the deferred rendering path
* The `WorldExample` class demonstrates how to load and work with a map file
